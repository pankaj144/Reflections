meaning means to make sense of an experience; we
make an interpretation of it. When we subsequently use this
interpretation to guide decision making or action, then making
meaning becomes learning. We learn differently when we are
learning to perform than when we are learning to understand
what is being communicated to us. Reflection enables us to
cor-rect distortions in our beliefs and errors in problem solving.
Critical reflection involves a critique of the presuppositions on
which our beliefs have been built
